# Neovim Configuration

This is my custom [Neovim] configuration. It features a single configuration
file [core.lua] and a custom color scheme called [peanut] which is based off of
[JellyBean]. In addition to integrated debugging, unit testing, language server
support, and treesitter highlighting, the following plugins are also included:
